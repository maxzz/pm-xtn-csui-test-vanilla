    1.
    Double or triple classes are used to get score 20/30 for selector specifity.

    2. TODO: We should not use # selectors since we may have multiple icons, but ID should be unique.
    This can be solved only with shadow DOM

    3. TODO:
    :root {
      --someVar: #000000;
    }

    4. TODO:
    z-index: 2147483647; -1 to avoid conflict with FBB. There is a problem with https://www.ipower.com/secure/login.bml#webmail (they reset it to 1)
